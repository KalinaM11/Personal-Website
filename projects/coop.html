        <p class="text-lg mb-4">This project is a data-driven co-op application website that supports five different types of
            users: Students, Companyb workers, Advisors, Alumni, and System Administrators. You can "sign in" to each persona by
        click on "Act as ___". Each persona has 3 pages, which each support essential needs for that persona. A rest API was used to 
    link together the backend SQL database (through SQL queries) and the front-end streamlit UI. We created our own Relational database
in SQL. </p>
